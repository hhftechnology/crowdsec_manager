# API Overview

CrowdSec Manager exposes a RESTful API for all its operations. The frontend communicates with the backend exclusively through this API.

## Base URL

All API endpoints are prefixed with `/api`.

Example: `http://localhost:8080/api/health/stack`

## Authentication

Currently, the API is protected by the internal network configuration. Access is restricted to the local network or via the exposed port/reverse proxy.

## Response Format

Responses are generally returned in JSON format.

### Success Response

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": { ... }
}
```

### Error Response

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Error description"
}
```
