# Notifications

The **Notifications** page allows you to configure how you want to be alerted when CrowdSec detects suspicious activity. Currently, Discord integration is supported, with more channels planned.

## Discord Integration

You can send alerts directly to a Discord channel using Webhooks.

<Steps>
  ### Enable Integration
  Toggle the **Enable** switch to turn on Discord notifications.

  ### Configure Webhook
  Paste your **Webhook URL** from Discord. The system will automatically extract the `Webhook ID` and `Webhook Token`.

  ### Optional Settings
  - **Geoapify API Key**: Required if you want to include static maps in your alert notifications.
  - **CrowdSec CTI Key**: Optional key for enhanced IP intelligence and maliciousness scores.

  ### Save and Apply
  Click **Save & Restart** to apply the changes.
</Steps>

<Callout type="important">
  Changes to notification settings require a restart of the CrowdSec container to take effect. Use the **Save & Restart** button to handle this automatically.
</Callout>

## Configuration Sources

The system can detect existing configurations from two sources:
- **Database**: Settings saved via this web interface.
- **Container**: Settings defined in environment variables or config files.

If a manual configuration is detected in the container, the UI will pre-populate the fields and alert you to the existing setup.
