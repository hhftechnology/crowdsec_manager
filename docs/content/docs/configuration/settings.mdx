# Settings

The **Settings** page (labeled Configuration in the UI) allows you to manage critical system paths and integration settings.

## Traefik Configuration Path

The most important setting is the **Traefik Dynamic Configuration Path**. This tells CrowdSec Manager where to find the `dynamic_config.yml` file inside the Traefik container.

- **Default Path**: `/etc/traefik/dynamic_config.yml`

### Why is this important?

CrowdSec Manager uses this path to:
- Verify the integration between Traefik and CrowdSec.
- Manage the Traefik whitelist.
- Configure and verify Captcha settings.
- Check middleware configurations.

<Callout type="important">
  If your Traefik setup uses a different path or filename for its dynamic configuration, you **must** update it here. Otherwise, features like Captcha and Whitelists will not function correctly.
</Callout>
