# Service Management

The **Services** page provides direct control over the core components of the CrowdSec stack. You can monitor their status, perform lifecycle actions, and manage console enrollment.

## Service Controls

For each detected service (e.g., `crowdsec`, `traefik`), you can perform the following actions:

- **Start**: Start a stopped service.
- **Stop**: Stop a running service.
- **Restart**: Restart the service (useful for applying configuration changes).

Status indicators show whether a service is `running` (Green) or `stopped` (Red).

## System Actions

### Graceful Shutdown
The **Graceful Shutdown** button initiates a controlled shutdown of the entire system. This ensures that all containers are stopped safely, preventing data corruption.

<Callout type="warn">
  This action will stop the entire CrowdSec stack. The web interface will become unavailable until the system is manually restarted from the host.
</Callout>

## Console Enrollment

You can enroll your CrowdSec instance with the **CrowdSec Central Console** to unlock advanced features:

- Centralized management of multiple instances.
- Access to Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI).
- Real-time metrics and alerts.
- Community blocklists.

### How to Enroll
1. Click **Enroll CrowdSec**.
2. Enter the enrollment key obtained from your [CrowdSec Console](https://app.crowdsec.net) account.
3. Click **Enroll**.
