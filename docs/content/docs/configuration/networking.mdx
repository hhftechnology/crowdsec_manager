# Networking

CrowdSec Manager requires specific network configurations to communicate with other services in your stack.

## The Pangolin Network

The application expects an external Docker network named `pangolin` to exist. This shared network allows CrowdSec Manager to communicate with:
- CrowdSec
- Traefik
- Other integrated services

### Creating the Network

```bash
docker network create pangolin
```

### Connecting Services

Ensure all related services in your `docker-compose.yml` are connected to this network:

```yaml
networks:
  pangolin:
    external: true

services:
  crowdsec-manager:
    networks:
      - pangolin
  
  traefik:
    networks:
      - pangolin
```

## Port Configuration

The application listens on port `8080` inside the container.

### Direct Access
Map the port directly to the host:

```yaml
ports:
  - "8080:8080"
```

### Reverse Proxy (Traefik)
If using Traefik, you don't need to expose the port. Instead, use labels:

```yaml
labels:
  - "traefik.enable=true"
  - "traefik.http.routers.manager.rule=Host(`manager.example.com`)"
  - "traefik.http.services.manager.loadbalancer.server.port=8080"
```
