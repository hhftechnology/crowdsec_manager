# Health & Diagnostics

The **Health** page provides a comprehensive overview of your CrowdSec stack's status, including Docker containers, connected bouncers, and integration with Traefik.

## System Status

The top section displays a high-level summary:

- **Overall Status**: Indicates if the system is `Healthy` or if `Issues Detected`.
- **Containers**: Shows the number of running containers versus the total expected containers.
- **Active Bouncers**: The count of currently connected enforcement agents.

## Detailed Diagnostics

The diagnostics are divided into three tabs:

### Containers

Lists all Docker containers managed by the CrowdSec stack.

- **Name**: Container name.
- **Container ID**: Shortened Docker container ID.
- **Status**: Current state (e.g., `running`, `exited`).
- **Running**: Visual indicator (Green Check or Red X).

### Bouncers

Displays a quick list of connected bouncers and their status. For full management capabilities, use the [Engines](/docs/features/engines) page.

### Traefik Integration

Monitors the status of the CrowdSec middleware integration with Traefik.

- **Middleware Configured**: Checks if the CrowdSec middleware is properly defined in Traefik.
- **LAPI Key Found**: Verifies that a valid Local API key is present for the middleware.
- **AppSec Enabled**: Indicates if Application Security (WAF) features are enabled.
- **Configuration Files**: Lists the detected Traefik configuration files being used.
