# Whitelist Management

Manage whitelists for both CrowdSec and Traefik directly from the interface. Whitelisting ensures that trusted IPs are never banned.

## Features

### View Whitelists
See all currently whitelisted IPs and CIDR ranges in a unified list.

### Quick Whitelist
Whitelist your current public IP with a single click. This is useful for ensuring you don't accidentally lock yourself out.

### Manual Entry
Whitelist specific IPs manually. You can add comments to remember why an IP was whitelisted.

### CIDR Support
Whitelist entire CIDR ranges (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`) to trust local networks or specific subnets.

### Service Selection
Choose where to apply the whitelist:
- **CrowdSec**: Prevents the IP from being banned by CrowdSec.
- **Traefik**: Allows the IP to bypass Traefik middleware restrictions.
- **Both**: Applies the whitelist to both services.

## Best Practices
- Always whitelist your static management IP.
- Whitelist internal Docker networks to prevent false positives.
- Regularly review whitelists to remove unused entries.
