# Remediation Metrics

The **Remediation Metrics** page (labeled as CrowdSec Health in the UI) provides a deep dive into the operational status of your CrowdSec Security Engine. It goes beyond simple up/down checks to provide detailed metrics on internal components.

## Health Checks

The system performs real-time checks on the following components:

- **Container Status**: Verifies that the CrowdSec Docker container is running and healthy.
- **Local API (LAPI)**: Checks connectivity and responsiveness of the Local API.
- **Metrics Endpoint**: Ensures that Prometheus metrics are being exposed correctly.
- **Bouncers**: Verifies that registered bouncers are connecting and pulling decisions.
- **CrowdSec Console**: Checks enrollment status with the Central Console (if configured).

## Status Indicators

Each component displays a status indicator:

- **Healthy** (Green): Operating normally.
- **Degraded** (Yellow): Working but with some non-critical issues.
- **Unhealthy** (Red): Critical failure, immediate attention required.
- **Warning** (Orange): Potential issue that needs investigation.
- **Info** (Blue): Informational status.

## Detailed Metrics

For the **Metrics Endpoint**, you can expand the card to view detailed internal counters, such as:

- **Acquisition**: Number of lines read, parsed, and unparsed.
- **Bucket**: Number of buckets created, poured, and overflowed.
- **Parser**: Hits and misses for various parsers.
- **LAPI**: Request counts and latency.

<Callout title="Troubleshooting">
If you see an **Unhealthy** status for the LAPI or Container, check the [Logs](/docs/features/logs-monitoring) page for error messages that might explain the failure.
