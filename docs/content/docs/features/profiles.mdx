# Profiles

The **Profiles** page provides a raw editor for the `profiles.yaml` configuration file. This file determines how CrowdSec handles alerts and what remediation actions are applied.

## Configuration Editor

You can directly edit the YAML content of your profiles configuration.

<Callout type="warn">
  **Advanced Feature**: Incorrect configuration in `profiles.yaml` can break your CrowdSec installation. Proceed with caution and ensure your YAML syntax is valid.
</Callout>

### Actions

- **Save**: Saves the changes to the file but does not apply them immediately.
- **Save & Restart**: Saves the changes and restarts the CrowdSec container to apply the new configuration.
- **Reset to Default**: Reverts the configuration to the default template provided by CrowdSec Manager.

## Common Use Cases

- Defining custom remediation policies (e.g., banning for 4 hours instead of the default).
- Configuring notifications for specific profiles.
- Setting up specific filters for alerts.
