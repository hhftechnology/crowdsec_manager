# Captcha Protection

The **Captcha** page allows you to configure captcha challenges as a remediation response. When a user triggers a specific scenario (e.g., suspicious browsing behavior), you can present them with a captcha instead of an outright ban.

## Supported Providers

CrowdSec Manager supports the following captcha providers:

- **Google reCAPTCHA** (v2/v3)
- **hCaptcha**
- **Cloudflare Turnstile**

## Configuration Status

The dashboard provides real-time feedback on your captcha configuration:

- **Active** (Green): Captcha is fully configured and the required HTML file exists.
- **Partially Configured** (Yellow): Configuration exists but the HTML file is missing, or vice versa.
- **Not Configured** (Gray): No captcha settings detected.

## Setup Guide

<Steps>
  ### Select Provider
  Choose your preferred provider from the dropdown menu.

  ### Enter Credentials
  Enter the **Site Key** (public) and **Secret Key** (private) obtained from your provider's dashboard.

  ### Apply Configuration
  Click **Configure Captcha**. This will update the `dynamic_config.yml` file and ensure the `captcha.html` template is present.
</Steps>
