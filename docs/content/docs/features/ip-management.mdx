# IP Management

CrowdSec Manager provides a comprehensive interface for managing IP addresses, including blocking, unbanning, and checking security status.

## Features

### Block IP
Manually block an IP address to prevent access to your services. You can specify the duration and reason for the ban.

### Unban IP
Remove a ban from an IP address if it was incorrectly flagged or if the threat has been mitigated.

### Security Check
Perform a comprehensive security check on an IP. This queries the CrowdSec local database to see if the IP is currently known or banned.

## Usage

1. Navigate to **IP Management**.
2. Use the search bar to find a specific IP.
3. Click on an IP to view details or perform actions.
4. Use the **Block** or **Unban** buttons to manage access.
