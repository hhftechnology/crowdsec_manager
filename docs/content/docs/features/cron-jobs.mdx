# Cron Jobs

CrowdSec Manager uses internal cron jobs to automate maintenance tasks.

## Default Jobs

### Backup Rotation
- **Schedule**: Daily at midnight.
- **Action**: Checks for backups older than `RETENTION_DAYS` and removes them.

### Stack Updates (Optional)
- **Schedule**: Configurable (default: weekly).
- **Action**: Checks for updates to the Docker images and applies them if configured.

## Configuration
Cron jobs are configured via environment variables or the `settings.db`. Currently, the backup rotation schedule is fixed, but the retention period is configurable.
