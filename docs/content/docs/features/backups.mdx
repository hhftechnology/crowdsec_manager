# Backup & Recovery

Protect your configuration with automated and manual backup options.

## Features

### Create Backup
Manually trigger a full system backup. This captures:
- Database (`settings.db`)
- Configuration files
- Environment settings

### Restore
Restore your system from any previous backup. The system will verify the backup integrity before restoring.
> [!WARNING]
> Restoring a backup will overwrite current settings and restart the application.

### List Backups
View all available backups with their creation date and size.

### Cleanup
Automatically or manually remove old backups based on your retention policy.

## Configuration
Configure backup settings in your `docker-compose.yml`:
- `BACKUP_DIR`: Location to store backups.
- `RETENTION_DAYS`: How long to keep backups (default: 60 days).
