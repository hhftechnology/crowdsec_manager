# Alerts Analysis

The **Alerts** page provides a powerful interface for searching, filtering, and analyzing security alerts generated by CrowdSec. This is your primary tool for investigating potential attacks and understanding threat patterns.

## Filtering Alerts

You can filter alerts using a wide range of criteria to narrow down your investigation.

### Available Filters

- **Alert ID**: Search for a specific alert by its unique ID.
- **Time Range**:
  - **Since**: e.g., `4h` (4 hours), `30d` (30 days).
  - **Until**: e.g., `1h` (1 hour ago).
- **Source**:
  - **IP Address**: Specific IP (e.g., `1.2.3.4`).
  - **IP Range**: CIDR notation (e.g., `1.2.3.0/24`).
- **Scope**: Filter by scope type (`ip`, `range`, etc.).
- **Value**: Match a specific value (e.g., a specific User-Agent or path).
- **Scenario**: Filter by the scenario name (e.g., `crowdsecurity/ssh-bf`).
- **Decision Type**: `ban`, `captcha`, `throttle`.
- **Origin**: Source of the alert (`cscli`, `crowdsec`, `CAPI`, etc.).
- **Include CAPI**: Checkbox to include alerts received from the CrowdSec Central API (community signals).
