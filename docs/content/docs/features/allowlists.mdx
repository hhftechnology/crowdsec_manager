# Allowlists

The **Allowlists** page allows you to manage centralized IP-based allowlists at the CrowdSec Local API (LAPI) level. These allowlists affect all security decisions, blocklist pulls, and WAF/AppSec behavior.

## Allowlists vs. Whitelists

<Callout type="info" title="Key Difference">
- **Allowlists**: Centralized filtering at the CrowdSec LAPI level. Affects the entire security engine. Only supports IPs and CIDR ranges.
- **Whitelists**: Often refers to Traefik-level whitelisting or specific parser whitelists.
</Callout>

If you need simple IP whitelisting for both CrowdSec and Traefik without the complexity of LAPI allowlists, you can use the separate **Whitelist** feature.

## Managing Allowlists

### Creating an Allowlist

<Steps>
  ### Click "Create Allowlist"

</Steps>

### Managing Entries

Once an allowlist is created, you can add or remove IPs.

1. Select the allowlist from the dropdown.
2. **Add Entries**:
   - Enter IPs or CIDR ranges (one per line).
   - (Optional) Set an expiration (e.g., `7d`, `24h`).
   - (Optional) Add a description for the entry.
3. **Remove Entries**:
