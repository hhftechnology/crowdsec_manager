# Architecture

CrowdSec Manager is built as a monolithic application with a clear separation between the backend API and the frontend UI.

## Backend (Go)

The backend is written in Go and handles:
- **API Server**: Exposes REST endpoints using `chi` router.
- **Docker Integration**: Communicates with the Docker daemon via the Docker SDK.
- **Database**: Uses SQLite for storing configuration and state.
- **Background Jobs**: Runs cron jobs for backups and maintenance.

### Key Packages
- `internal/api`: HTTP handlers and routing.
- `internal/docker`: Docker client wrapper.
- `internal/database`: Database models and queries.
- `internal/cron`: Scheduled task manager.

## Frontend (React)

The frontend is a Single Page Application (SPA) built with React and Vite.
- **UI Library**: Uses Shadcn UI for components.
- **State Management**: Uses React Query for data fetching and caching.
- **Routing**: Client-side routing for navigation.

## Communication

The frontend communicates with the backend via HTTP requests to the `/api` endpoints. Real-time data (logs) is delivered via WebSockets.
